### java正则表达式

<hr>



#### 1、正则表达式

（1）介绍

正则：regular expression，带有规律格式的表达式

作用：做字符串格式匹配、替换、检索

检索需要java两个类：Pattern（模式）、Matcher类（匹配器）



（2）正则发展

Ken Tompson，Unix之父，把正则表达式应用于计算机搜索领域

搜索匹配引擎：

+ DFA：不需要回溯，性能快（Mysql）
+ NFA：回溯算法，性能慢（Java .net）



（3）使用

\t：制表符

\n：换行

\r：回车

## Backslashes, escapes, and quoting

The backslash character (`'\'`) serves to introduce escaped constructs（转义结构）, as defined in the table above, as well as to quote（引号） characters that otherwise would be interpreted as unescaped constructs. Thus the expression `\\` matches a single backslash and `\{` matches a left brace.

It is an error to use a backslash prior to any alphabetic character that does not denote an escaped construct（一个\\构不成转义）; these are reserved for future extensions to the regular-expression language. A backslash may be used prior to a non-alphabetic character regardless of whether that character is part of an unescaped construct.

Backslashes within string literals in Java source code are interpreted as required by The Java™ Language Specification as either Unicode escapes (section 3.3) or other character escapes (section 3.10.6) It is therefore necessary to double backslashes in string literals that represent regular expressions to protect them from interpretation by the Java bytecode compiler. The string literal `"\b"`, for example, matches a single backspace character when interpreted as a regular expression, while `"\\b"` matches a word boundary（**\\\\b**才表示单词边界）. The string literal"\(hello\)" is illegal and leads to a compile-time error; in order to match the string `(hello)` the string literal `"\\(hello\\)"` must be used.

Character classes may appear within other character classes, and may be composed by the union operator (implicit) and the intersection operator (`&&`). The union operator denotes a class that contains every character that is in at least one of its operand classes. The intersection operator denotes a class that contains every character that is in both of its operand classes.

The precedence of character-class operators is as follows, from highest to lowest:

| Precedence | Name           | Example          |
| ---------- | -------------- | ---------------- |
| 1          | Literal escape | `\x`             |
| 2          | Grouping       | `[...]`          |
| 3          | Range          | `a-z`            |
| 4          | Union          | `[a-e][i-u]`     |
| 5          | Intersection   | `[a-z&&[aeiou]]` |



Note that a different set of metacharacters are in effect inside a character class than outside a character class. For instance, the regular expression `.` loses its special meaning inside a character class, while the expression `-` becomes a range forming metacharacter.

## Line terminators

A *line terminator* is a one- or two-character sequence that marks the end of a line of the input character sequence. The following are recognized as line terminators:

- A newline (line feed) character (`'\n'`),
- A carriage-return character followed immediately by a newline character (`"\r\n"`),
- A standalone carriage-return character (`'\r'`),
- A next-line character (`'\u0085'`),
- A line-separator character (`'\u2028'`), or
- A paragraph-separator character (`'\u2029'`).



If [`UNIX_LINES`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/13/docs/api/java.base/java/util/regex/Pattern.html#UNIX_LINES) mode is activated, then the only line terminators recognized are newline characters.

The regular expression `.` matches any character except a line terminator unless the [`DOTALL`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/13/docs/api/java.base/java/util/regex/Pattern.html#DOTALL) flag is specified.

By default, the regular expressions `^` and `$` ignore line terminators and only match at the beginning and the end, respectively, of the entire input sequence. If [`MULTILINE`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/13/docs/api/java.base/java/util/regex/Pattern.html#MULTILINE) mode is activated then `^` matches at the beginning of input and after any line terminator except at the end of input. When in [`MULTILINE`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/13/docs/api/java.base/java/util/regex/Pattern.html#MULTILINE) mode `$` matches just before a line terminator or the end of the input sequence.

## Groups and capturing

### Group number

Capturing groups are numbered by counting their opening parentheses from left to right. In the expression `((A)(B(C)))`, for example, there are four such groups:

1. `((A)(B(C)))`
2. `(A)`
3. `(B(C))`
4. `(C)`

Group zero always stands for the entire expression.

Capturing groups are so named because, during a match, each subsequence of the input sequence that matches such a group is saved. The captured subsequence may be used later in the expression, via a back reference, and may also be retrieved from the matcher once the match operation is complete.

### Group name

A capturing group can also be assigned a "name", a `named-capturing group`, and then be back-referenced later by the "name". Group names are composed of the following characters. The first character must be a `letter`.

- The uppercase letters `'A'` through `'Z'` (`'\u0041'` through `'\u005a'`),
- The lowercase letters `'a'` through `'z'` (`'\u0061'` through `'\u007a'`),
- The digits `'0'` through `'9'` (`'\u0030'` through `'\u0039'`),



A `named-capturing group` is still numbered as described in [Group number](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/13/docs/api/java.base/java/util/regex/Pattern.html#gnumber).

The captured input associated with a group is always the subsequence that the group most recently matched. If a group is evaluated a second time because of quantification then its previously-captured value, if any, will be retained if the second evaluation fails. Matching the string `"aba"` against the expression `(a(b)?)+`, for example, leaves group two set to `"b"`. All captured input is discarded at the beginning of each match.

Groups beginning with `(?` are either pure, *non-capturing* groups that do not capture text and do not count towards the group total, or *named-capturing* group.

## Unicode support

This class is in conformance with Level 1 of [*Unicode Technical Standard #18: Unicode Regular Expression*](http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr18/), plus RL2.1 Canonical Equivalents and RL2.2 Extended Grapheme Clusters.

**Unicode escape sequences** such as `\u2014` in Java source code are processed as described in section 3.3 of The Java™ Language Specification. Such escape sequences are also implemented directly by the regular-expression parser so that Unicode escapes can be used in expressions that are read from files or from the keyboard. Thus the strings `"\u2014"` and `"\\u2014"`, while not equal, compile into the same pattern, which matches the character with hexadecimal value `0x2014`.

A Unicode character can also be represented by using its **Hex notation** (hexadecimal code point value) directly as described in construct `\x{...}`, for example a supplementary character U+2011F can be specified as `\x{2011F}`, instead of two consecutive Unicode escape sequences of the surrogate pair `\uD840``\uDD1F`.

**Unicode character names** are supported by the named character construct `\N{`...`}`, for example, `\N{WHITE SMILING FACE}` specifies character `\u263A`. The character names supported by this class are the valid Unicode character names matched by [`Character.codePointOf(name)`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/13/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/Character.html#codePointOf(java.lang.String)).

[**Unicode extended grapheme clusters**](http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr18/#Default_Grapheme_Clusters) are supported by the grapheme cluster matcher `\X` and the corresponding boundary matcher `\b{g}`.

Unicode scripts, blocks, categories and binary properties are written with the `\p` and `\P` constructs as in Perl. `\p{`*prop*`}` matches if the input has the property *prop*, while `\P{`*prop*`}` does not match if the input has that property.

Scripts, blocks, categories and binary properties can be used both inside and outside of a character class.

**Scripts** are specified either with the prefix `Is`, as in `IsHiragana`, or by using the `script` keyword (or its short form `sc`) as in `script=Hiragana` or `sc=Hiragana`.

The script names supported by `Pattern` are the valid script names accepted and defined by [`UnicodeScript.forName`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/13/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/Character.UnicodeScript.html#forName(java.lang.String)).

**Blocks** are specified with the prefix `In`, as in `InMongolian`, or by using the keyword `block` (or its short form `blk`) as in `block=Mongolian` or `blk=Mongolian`.

The block names supported by `Pattern` are the valid block names accepted and defined by [`UnicodeBlock.forName`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/13/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/Character.UnicodeBlock.html#forName(java.lang.String)).

**Categories** may be specified with the optional prefix `Is`: Both `\p{L}` and `\p{IsL}` denote the category of Unicode letters. Same as scripts and blocks, categories can also be specified by using the keyword `general_category` (or its short form `gc`) as in `general_category=Lu` or `gc=Lu`.

The supported categories are those of [*The Unicode Standard*](http://www.unicode.org/unicode/standard/standard.html) in the version specified by the [`Character`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/13/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/Character.html) class. The category names are those defined in the Standard, both normative and informative.

**Binary properties** are specified with the prefix `Is`, as in `IsAlphabetic`. The supported binary properties by `Pattern` are

- Alphabetic
- Ideographic
- Letter
- Lowercase
- Uppercase
- Titlecase
- Punctuation
- Control
- White_Space
- Digit
- Hex_Digit
- Join_Control
- Noncharacter_Code_Point
- Assigned



The following **Predefined Character classes** and **POSIX character classes** are in conformance with the recommendation of *Annex C: Compatibility Properties* of [*Unicode Regular Expression* ](http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr18/), when [`UNICODE_CHARACTER_CLASS`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/13/docs/api/java.base/java/util/regex/Pattern.html#UNICODE_CHARACTER_CLASS) flag is specified.

| `\p{Space}`  | A whitespace character:`\p{IsWhite_Space}`                   |
| `\d`         | A digit: `\p{IsDigit}`                                       |
| `\D`         | A non-digit: `[^\d]`                                         |
| `\s`         | A whitespace character: `\p{IsWhite_Space}`                  |
| `\S`         | A non-whitespace character: `[^\s]`                          |
| `\w`         | A word character: `[\p{Alpha}\p{gc=Mn}\p{gc=Me}\p{gc=Mc}\p{Digit}\p{gc=Pc}\p{IsJoin_Control}]` |
| `\W`         | A non-word character: `[^\w]`                                |



 Categories that behave like the java.lang.Character boolean is*methodname* methods (except for the deprecated ones) are available through the same `\p{`*prop*`}` syntax where the specified property has the name `java*methodname*`.

## Comparison to Perl 5

The `Pattern` engine performs traditional NFA-based matching with ordered alternation as occurs in Perl 5.

Perl constructs not supported by this class:

- The backreference constructs, `\g{`*n*`}` for the *n*th[capturing group](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/13/docs/api/java.base/java/util/regex/Pattern.html#cg) and `\g{`*name*`}` for [named-capturing group](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/13/docs/api/java.base/java/util/regex/Pattern.html#groupname).
- The conditional constructs `(?(`*condition*`)`*X*`)` and `(?(`*condition*`)`*X*`|`*Y*`)`,
- The embedded code constructs `(?{`*code*`})` and `(??{`*code*`})`,
- The embedded comment syntax `(?#comment)`, and
- The preprocessing operations `\l` `\u`, `\L`, and `\U`.

Constructs supported by this class but not by Perl:

- Character-class union and intersection as described [above](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/13/docs/api/java.base/java/util/regex/Pattern.html#cc).

Notable differences from Perl:

- In Perl, `\1` through `\9` are always interpreted as back references; a backslash-escaped number greater than `9` is treated as a back reference if at least that many subexpressions exist, otherwise it is interpreted, if possible, as an octal escape. In this class octal escapes must always begin with a zero. In this class, `\1` through `\9` are always interpreted as back references, and a larger number is accepted as a back reference if at least that many subexpressions exist at that point in the regular expression, otherwise the parser will drop digits until the number is smaller or equal to the existing number of groups or it is one digit.
- Perl uses the `g` flag to request a match that resumes where the last match left off. This functionality is provided implicitly by the [`Matcher`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/13/docs/api/java.base/java/util/regex/Matcher.html) class: Repeated invocations of the [`find`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/13/docs/api/java.base/java/util/regex/Matcher.html#find()) method will resume where the last match left off, unless the matcher is reset.
- In Perl, embedded flags at the top level of an expression affect the whole expression. In this class, embedded flags always take effect at the point at which they appear, whether they are at the top level or within a group; in the latter case, flags are restored at the end of the group just as in Perl.

  ## Field Details

  - ### UNIX_LINES

    public static final int UNIX_LINES

    Enables Unix lines mode.

    In this mode, only the `'\n'` line terminator is recognized in the behavior of `.`, `^`, and `$`.

    Unix lines mode can also be enabled via the embedded flag expression `(?d)`.

    - **See Also:**

      [Constant Field Values](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/13/docs/api/constant-values.html#java.util.regex.Pattern.UNIX_LINES)

  - ### CASE_INSENSITIVE

    public static final int CASE_INSENSITIVE

    Enables case-insensitive matching.

    By default, case-insensitive matching assumes that only characters in the US-ASCII charset are being matched. Unicode-aware case-insensitive matching can be enabled by specifying the [`UNICODE_CASE`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/13/docs/api/java.base/java/util/regex/Pattern.html#UNICODE_CASE) flag in conjunction with this flag.

    Case-insensitive matching can also be enabled via the embedded flag expression `(?i)`.

    Specifying this flag may impose a slight performance penalty.

    - **See Also:**

      [Constant Field Values](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/13/docs/api/constant-values.html#java.util.regex.Pattern.CASE_INSENSITIVE)

  - ### COMMENTS

    public static final int COMMENTS

    Permits whitespace and comments in pattern.

    In this mode, whitespace is ignored, and embedded comments starting with `#` are ignored until the end of a line.

    Comments mode can also be enabled via the embedded flag expression `(?x)`.

    - **See Also:**

      [Constant Field Values](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/13/docs/api/constant-values.html#java.util.regex.Pattern.COMMENTS)

  - ### MULTILINE

    public static final int MULTILINE

    Enables multiline mode.

    In multiline mode the expressions `^` and `$` match just after or just before, respectively, a line terminator or the end of the input sequence. By default these expressions only match at the beginning and the end of the entire input sequence.

    Multiline mode can also be enabled via the embedded flag expression `(?m)`.

    - **See Also:**

      [Constant Field Values](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/13/docs/api/constant-values.html#java.util.regex.Pattern.MULTILINE)

  - ### LITERAL

    public static final int LITERAL

    Enables literal parsing of the pattern.

    When this flag is specified then the input string that specifies the pattern is treated as a sequence of literal characters. Metacharacters or escape sequences in the input sequence will be given no special meaning.

    The flags CASE_INSENSITIVE and UNICODE_CASE retain their impact on matching when used in conjunction with this flag. The other flags become superfluous.

    There is no embedded flag character for enabling literal parsing.

    - **See Also:**

      [Constant Field Values](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/13/docs/api/constant-values.html#java.util.regex.Pattern.LITERAL)

  - ### DOTALL

    public static final int DOTALL

    Enables dotall mode.

    In dotall mode, the expression `.` matches any character, including a line terminator. By default this expression does not match line terminators.

    Dotall mode can also be enabled via the embedded flag expression `(?s)`. (The `s` is a mnemonic for "single-line" mode, which is what this is called in Perl.)

    - **See Also:**

      [Constant Field Values](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/13/docs/api/constant-values.html#java.util.regex.Pattern.DOTALL)

  - ### UNICODE_CASE

    public static final int UNICODE_CASE

    Enables Unicode-aware case folding.

    When this flag is specified then case-insensitive matching, when enabled by the [`CASE_INSENSITIVE`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/13/docs/api/java.base/java/util/regex/Pattern.html#CASE_INSENSITIVE) flag, is done in a manner consistent with the Unicode Standard. By default, case-insensitive matching assumes that only characters in the US-ASCII charset are being matched.

    Unicode-aware case folding can also be enabled via the embedded flag expression `(?u)`.

    Specifying this flag may impose a performance penalty.

    - **See Also:**

      [Constant Field Values](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/13/docs/api/constant-values.html#java.util.regex.Pattern.UNICODE_CASE)

  - ### CANON_EQ

    public static final int CANON_EQ

    Enables canonical equivalence.

    When this flag is specified then two characters will be considered to match if, and only if, their full canonical decompositions match. The expression `"a\u030A"`, for example, will match the string `"\u00E5"` when this flag is specified. By default, matching does not take canonical equivalence into account.

    There is no embedded flag character for enabling canonical equivalence.

    Specifying this flag may impose a performance penalty.

    - **See Also:**

      [Constant Field Values](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/13/docs/api/constant-values.html#java.util.regex.Pattern.CANON_EQ)

  - ### UNICODE_CHARACTER_CLASS

    public static final int UNICODE_CHARACTER_CLASS

    Enables the Unicode version of   .

    The UNICODE_CHARACTER_CLASS mode can also be enabled via the embedded flag expression `(?U)`.

    The flag implies UNICODE_CASE, that is, it enables Unicode-aware case folding.

    Specifying this flag may impose a performance penalty.

    - **Since:**

      1.7

    - **Throws:**

      `IllegalArgumentException` - If bit values other than those corresponding to the defined match flags are set in `flags`

      `PatternSyntaxException` - If the expression's syntax is invalid

  - ### pattern

    public [String](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/13/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/String.html) pattern()

    Returns the regular expression from which this pattern was compiled.

    - **Returns:**

      The source of this pattern

    Returns the string representation of this pattern. This is the regular expression from which this pattern was compiled.

    - **Overrides:**

      `toString` in class `Object`

    - **Returns:**

      The string representation of this pattern

    - **Since:**

      1.5

  - ### matcher

    public [Matcher](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/13/docs/api/java.base/java/util/regex/Matcher.html) matcher([CharSequence](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/13/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/CharSequence.html) input)

    Creates a matcher that will match the given input against this pattern.

    - **Parameters:**

      `input` - The character sequence to be matched

    - **Returns:**

      A new matcher for this pattern

  - ### flags

    public int flags()

    Returns this pattern's match flags.

    - **Returns:**

      The match flags specified when this pattern was compiled

  - ### matches

    public static boolean matches([String](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/13/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/String.html) regex, [CharSequence](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/13/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/CharSequence.html) input)

    Compiles the given regular expression and attempts to match the given input against it.

    An invocation of this convenience method of the form

    > ```
    >  Pattern.matches(regex, input);
    > ```

    behaves in exactly the same way as the expression

    > ```
    >  Pattern.compile(regex).matcher(input).matches()
    > ```

    

    If a pattern is to be used multiple times, compiling it once and reusing it will be more efficient than invoking this method each time.

    - **Parameters:**

      `regex` - The expression to be compiled

      `input` - The character sequence to be matched

    - **Returns:**

      whether or not the regular expression matches on the input

    - **Throws:**

      `PatternSyntaxException` - If the expression's syntax is invalid

  - ### split

    public [String](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/13/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/String.html)[] split([CharSequence](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/13/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/CharSequence.html) input, int limit)

    Splits the given input sequence around matches of this pattern.

    The array returned by this method contains each substring of the input sequence that is terminated by another subsequence that matches this pattern or is terminated by the end of the input sequence. The substrings in the array are in the order in which they occur in the input. If this pattern does not match any subsequence of the input then the resulting array has just one element, namely the input sequence in string form.

    When there is a positive-width match at the beginning of the input sequence then an empty leading substring is included at the beginning of the resulting array. A zero-width match at the beginning however never produces such empty leading substring.

    The `limit` parameter controls the number of times the pattern is applied and therefore affects the length of the resulting array.

    - If the *limit* is positive then the pattern will be applied at most *limit* - 1 times, the array's length will be no greater than *limit*, and the array's last entry will contain all input beyond the last matched delimiter.
    - If the *limit* is zero then the pattern will be applied as many times as possible, the array can have any length, and trailing empty strings will be discarded.
    - If the *limit* is negative then the pattern will be applied as many times as possible and the array can have any length.

    

    The input `"boo:and:foo"`, for example, yields the following results with these parameters:

    | Regex |                           Limit | Result                          |
    | ----: | ------------------------------: | ------------------------------- |
    |     : |                               2 | `{ "boo", "and:foo" }`          |
    |     5 |       `{ "boo", "and", "foo" }` |                                 |
    |    -2 |       `{ "boo", "and", "foo" }` |                                 |
    |     o |                               5 | `{ "b", "", ":and:f", "", "" }` |
    |    -2 | `{ "b", "", ":and:f", "", "" }` |                                 |
    |     0 |         `{ "b", "", ":and:f" }` |                                 |

    

    - **Parameters:**

      `input` - The character sequence to be split

      `limit` - The result threshold, as described above

    - **Returns:**

      The array of strings computed by splitting the input around matches of this pattern

  - ### split

    public [String](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/13/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/String.html)[] split([CharSequence](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/13/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/CharSequence.html) input)

    Splits the given input sequence around matches of this pattern.

    This method works as if by invoking the two-argument [`split`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/13/docs/api/java.base/java/util/regex/Pattern.html#split(java.lang.CharSequence,int)) method with the given input sequence and a limit argument of zero. Trailing empty strings are therefore not included in the resulting array.

    The input `"boo:and:foo"`, for example, yields the following results with these expressions:

    | Regex | Result                    |
    | ----- | ------------------------- |
    | :     | `{ "boo", "and", "foo" }` |
    | o     | `{ "b", "", ":and:f" }`   |

    

    - **Parameters:**

      `input` - The character sequence to be split

    - **Returns:**

      The array of strings computed by splitting the input around matches of this pattern

    Returns a literal pattern   .Metacharacters or escape sequences in the input sequence will be given no special meaning.

    - **Parameters:**

      `s` - The string to be literalized

    - **Returns:**

      A literal string replacement

    - **Since:**

      1.5

  - ### asPredicate

    public [Predicate](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/13/docs/api/java.base/java/util/function/Predicate.html)<[String](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/13/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/String.html)> asPredicate()

    Creates a predicate that tests if this pattern is found in a given input string.

    - **API Note:**

      This method creates a predicate that behaves as if it creates a matcher from the input sequence and then calls `find`, for example a predicate of the form:`    s -> matcher(s).find();  `

    - **Returns:**

      The predicate which can be used for finding a match on a subsequence of a string

    - **Since:**

      1.8

    - **See Also:**

      [`Matcher.find()`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/13/docs/api/java.base/java/util/regex/Matcher.html#find())

  - ### asMatchPredicate

    public [Predicate](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/13/docs/api/java.base/java/util/function/Predicate.html)<[String](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/13/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/String.html)> asMatchPredicate()

    Creates a predicate that tests if this pattern matches a given input string.

    - **API Note:**

      This method creates a predicate that behaves as if it creates a matcher from the input sequence and then calls `matches`, for example a predicate of the form:`    s -> matcher(s).matches();  `

    - **Returns:**

      The predicate which can be used for matching an input string against this pattern.

    - **Since:**

      11

  - ### splitAsStream

    public [Stream](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/13/docs/api/java.base/java/util/stream/Stream.html)<[String](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/13/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/String.html)> splitAsStream([CharSequence](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/13/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/CharSequence.html) input)

    Creates a stream from the given input sequence around matches of this pattern.

    The stream returned by this method contains each substring of the input sequence that is terminated by another subsequence that matches this pattern or is terminated by the end of the input sequence. The substrings in the stream are in the order in which they occur in the input. Trailing empty strings will be discarded and not encountered in the stream.

    If this pattern does not match any subsequence of the input then the resulting stream has just one element, namely the input sequence in string form.

    When there is a positive-width match at the beginning of the input sequence then an empty leading substring is included at the beginning of the stream. A zero-width match at the beginning however never produces such empty leading substring.

    If the input sequence is mutable, it must remain constant during the execution of the terminal stream operation. Otherwise, the result of the terminal stream operation is undefined.

    - **Parameters:**

      `input` - The character sequence to be split

    - **Returns:**

      The stream of strings computed by splitting the input around matches of this pattern

    - **Since:**

      1.8
